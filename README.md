# CROSSMINT MEGAVERSE
This is a challenge for creating a 2D Megaverse for applying to Crossmint

# RUNNING LOCALLY
For runnning this project you must:
- Add a .env file with the properties detailed in .env.example file.

- Run the command `npm install`

- Run the command `npm run dev`

And there you are, you just runned the Megaverse creator.


# NOTES

I created three more approaches on how to solve this problem, but the most efficient way (at least for this scenario) was doing it synchronously, but you can check the other solutions in the secondary branches of the project.
